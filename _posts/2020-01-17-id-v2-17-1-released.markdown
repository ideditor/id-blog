Joyous January! iD version [2.17.1](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/releases/tag/v2.17.1) is now [live for editing](https://openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=id). This patch focuses on bug fixes and little niceties but also brings a few new tricks. See the [changelog](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/release/CHANGELOG.md#2171) for details.

#### Reordering Field Values

{: .full-width}

Many fields take multiple, ordered values. For example, destinations on highway exits should typically be listed the way they appear on signage. You can now reorder these values via drag-and-drop. Simple!

This feature was originally [submitted by Arjun Gupta](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/pull/7024).

#### Power Plant Feature Types

Different types of power stations are now easier to add, including solar and wind farms, nuclear and hydroelectric plants, and fossil fuel-burning facilities. Find out where your local power comes from and get it on the map ðŸ”Œ

#### New Icons

Various feature types sport new icons as part of our continued effort to keep features easily distinguishable. Also check out [icons we added in v2.17.0](/2019/12/30/id-v2-17-0-released#new-icons).

You can download or contribute to iD's public domain icons at the [Temaki](https://github.com/ideditor/temaki) project.


#### Note to Developers

We've dropped support for Node 8, which [reached end-of-life](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#end-of-life-releases) on December 31st, 2019. Node 10 or higher is now required when building iD.
